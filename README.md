# Lensless-Microscopy
Research Project on developing a lensless microscope using Raspberry Pi HQ camera. 

Tuberculosis remains a global health concern, and the ability to rapidly and accurately diagnose this disease is paramount. Our project takes a novel approach to address this challenge by developing an affordable and versatile lensless microscope. Using a Raspberry Pi HQ Camera and an LED Dot Matrix controlled by a MAX7219, we explore multi-angle illumination as a means to improve the clarity and resolution of microscopic images. Furthermore, the application of the lensless microscope lies in the counting of microcoloniesâ€”a key step in the diagnosis of TB and various other microbiological assays, therefore, a microcolony counting software has been developed.
